We need to create a web-based interface where we can see a map. There will be data points in the map representing the stores, and each store will have available information on the products they have and the cost of those products. A customer can choose where he/she is. He/She can also choose the products needed and the quantity for each product. A shopper can choose where he/she is and request for routes and the skyline options will be shown to him/her.
